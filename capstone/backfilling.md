In Airflow, `"backfilling"` refers to the process of running a DAG for a series of past dates that were missed. This is relevant when you have a DAG that's scheduled to run periodically (like daily or hourly), but for some reason, it didn't run for a period of time.

The line `catchup=False` in the DAG definition is what prevents backfilling:

```python
with DAG(
    'postgres_to_bigquery_etl',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='ETL DAG for uploading multiple tables from Postgres to BigQuery via GCS',
    schedule_interval='@once',
    catchup=False,
    max_active_runs=1
) as dag:
```

Here's what this means in practice:

1. If `catchup=True` (the default), and you enable a DAG that was supposed to run daily for the past week but didn't, Airflow would automatically try to run the DAG for each of those missed days to "catch up".

2. With `catchup=False`, as in this DAG, if the DAG misses any scheduled runs, it won't try to make up for them. It will only run for the current schedule and move forward from there.

In this specific DAG, `catchup=False` is actually redundant because the `schedule_interval='@once'` means the DAG is only meant to run one time anyway, not on a recurring schedule. However, it's a good practice to include it for clarity and in case the schedule is changed in the future.

This setting is particularly useful for ETL processes where you typically want to load the most current data rather than historical data. It prevents unexpected large backfills that could overload your systems or result in duplicating historical data loads.
